## Thoughts

First foray into Dendron. I'm not quite sure where to start, so what I'll be
doing is treating this repo like a sandbox for testing out things in Dendron
before I decide to convert everything in my main `2022-goals` repo to Dendron.

First project: configure the VS Code environment that I'm using with this repo
to make this a better markdown editor. Pulling recommendations from [this
site](https://thisdavej.com/build-an-amazing-markdown-editor-using-visual-studio-code-and-pandoc/).

I'm also trying out the P.A.R.A. method of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM),
so there are a few things going on with this repo, sorry for the mess if you're
here visiting.
