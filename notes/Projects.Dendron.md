"...a project without a corresponding goal is known as a "hobby." If you're not
committed to or haven't fully articulated the outcome you want, you must be
doing it just for fun" - Tiago Forte

## Purpose

I'll be using this doc to capture high-level requirements and tasks that I'll be
using to familiarize myself with Dendron.

- [X] Install Dendron
- [X] Install markdown-lint extension for VS Code
- [X] Install vscode-pandoc
- [X] Create config files to make a better markdown editor
  - [X] Create a `settings.json` file
  - [X] Create a `.markdownlint.json` file
  - [X] Create a `style.css` file
