## Thoughts

Heading back in to the repo, still trying to wrap my brain around what I'm going
to do.

It's weird feeling this lost, it's been a while since I stalled on what to do
next. Taking a look at what I did last night, I don't particularly like the CSS
that I copied, so deleted it today, and also deleted the line in the
[settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) file.

Since I don't really know where to start, and I can't just 'make stuff up' to
get this going, I'm going to tackle things a different way. I'm going to
primarily use this as a sandbox (like I said in [yesterday's
journal](daily.journal.2022.06.29.md)) and only come back to this repo when I
want to try something new. I'm already committed to trying things out, so I
might as well dive in all the way and just do it.

So the next steps for me are:

- Go back to my private repo
- Install Dendron
- Start using the default Dendron features (daily journal, root) to build out a
  parallel hierarchy in my main repo
- Gradually use more features of Dendron as I get more familiar with it
- Come back to this repo to try out different features before I apply major
  changes to my main repo

Obviously this repo will be active, but I can't definitively say that I'll be on
a specific update schedule with it.
